  <h1>Welcome to Furqhan's component library</h1>
  
 <p><strong>Adarsh Balika</strong> is attending neog.camp and is currently completing levelZero one weekend and assignment at a time.

  This is a component library created by her to better design each element.
  
  After creating this library she is going to use the components in her <strong>portfolio, blog and all projects</strong> created. 
  This will ensure that all her projects have consistent themeing and styling </p>
